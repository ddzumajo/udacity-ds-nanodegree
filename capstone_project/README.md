# Airbnb Price Prediction Project

This project is the final project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, where we delve into the world of Airbnb apartments in Manhattan, New York. The objective is to gain insights into the factors influencing apartment prices and develop a model that accurately predicts these prices. By leveraging the power of data analysis and machine learning techniques, we can uncover valuable patterns and trends in the Airbnb dataset to assist both hosts and guests in making informed decisions.

## Introduction
The ability to predict apartment prices in Manhattan is crucial for both hosts and guests in the competitive Airbnb market. As the final project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, this project showcases the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program. By applying data science techniques, we aim to analyze the Airbnb dataset, clean and preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and develop a regression model for price prediction.

In this project, we employ the random forest model, an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. By utilizing random forest, we can capture non-linear relationships and interactions among the features, providing a powerful tool for predicting prices in complex datasets like the Airbnb apartment dataset.

## Technical Section
To perform the analysis and build the price prediction model, we utilize Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions.
- Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures and operations for efficiently handling structured data.
- Seaborn: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides a range of tools and algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.

The random forest model from the scikit-learn library is used to perform the price prediction. This model enables us to capture non-linear relationships, making it well-suited for predicting apartment prices based on various features.
